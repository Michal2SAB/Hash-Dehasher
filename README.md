# Hash-Dehasher
A simple program to find the real string for your hash. MD5, SHA256, any really. Works really fast, gets to the "aaaa" combo in about 1 second (on a bad pc, with youtube running in the background).

# FLAWS

- Does not check uppercase strings, only lowercase.
- No special symbols, just alphabet letters from a-z and numbers from 0-9.

# REQUIREMENTS

Just install node.js and you're good.

# WANNA TEST IT?
If you want to test if this program is really working, generate a hash from a random string like "aaa" for example  and paste that hash onto the program. It will find your hash and create a file called "Dehashed.txt" in your folder with the info.

You can generate hashes on sites such as this: https://passwordsgenerator.net/md5-hash-generator/
